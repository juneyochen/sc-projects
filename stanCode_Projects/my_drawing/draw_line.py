This file help user draw lines on the window. When the mouse points at the window,
the point will be the first point of the line. Then, when the mouse points the second
time, the point will be the end point of the line.
Reminder:
As the first point is created, there will be a circle on the point.
Then when the second point was selected, the circle of the first point
will disappear.
